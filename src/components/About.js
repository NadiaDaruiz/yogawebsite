              Yoga has been part of my life since I was a child. My mother took me to one of her yoga classes when I was 8 years old. And I still remember the fascination that I felt when I hear the sound OMM.

              At the age of 18, I started to practice Hatha yoga. And
              later on, during a long trip in South America I discovered
              Ashtanga and Kundalini.

              Finally when I was 30, I decided to study yoga in the "Asociaci√≥n Bonaerense de Yoga" in Buenos Aires. And during two years I committed myself to practice and study yoga every day.

              Recently I went to India to  understand better the culture that gave birth to this amazing philosophy.

              For the last three years I have been teaching yoga everywhere I go.
